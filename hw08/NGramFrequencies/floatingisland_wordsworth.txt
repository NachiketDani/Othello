Floating Island By Dorothy Wordsworth.

Harmonious Powers with Nature work On sky, earth, river, lake, and sea: Sunshine and storm, whirlwind and breeze, All in one duteous task agree.

Once did I see a slip of earth, By throbbing waves long undermined, Loosed from its hold; - how no one knew. 
But all might see it float, obedient to the wind
